Topic: Age and Smoking - A Comprehensive Analysis Using Frequentist and Bayesian Methods

Authors: Kiana Philpott, Chizurum Ewelike, Layo Faloseyi

Research Hypothesis: 
This study aims to analyze the age demographics of those who smoke. The null hypothesis, H0, assumes that the average age of smokers is 60 years or younger, while the alternative hypothesis, H1, assumes that the average age of individuals who smoke is greater than 60 years.

Background:
The nature of smoking remains a public health issue, and seems to affect people across varying age groups. This research aims to determine whether older adults are the most likely to smoke. In doing so, we might be able to recognize patterns that could inform the public health sector and contribute to reduced smoking rates. This study is particularly interesting as it highlights how societal attitudes towards smoking could evolve over time.

Data Sketch: 
The dataset includes survey data on smoking habits from the United Kingdom. The dataset can be used for analyzing demographic characteristics of smokers.

Size: There are 12 variables & there are 1691 observations
Format: CSV
Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/smoking-dataset-from-uk?resource=download
Analysis: The tentative analysis plan is as follows:
1. Check for the need of data cleaning
2. Get familiar with the dataset itself
3. Create visualizations to show the distribution of age and smoking to enhance understanding
4. Frequentist approach:
- Conduct a T-Test that compares the mean age of smokers to the age variable
- Validate assumptions for the T-Test (normality & homogeneity of variances)
- Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean ago of smokers to further asses the accuracy of our estimate 5. Bayesian approach:
- Conduct a Bayesian T-Test using prior distribution
- Analyze the posterior distribution to estimate the mean age & credible interval to help assess the probability that the mean age of smokers is greater than 60 years
- Conduct a prior sensitivity analysis by testing different priors to understand the impact they have on the results
6. Compare the results from each approach (includes: interpretation & visualizations) 7. Document findings & results
